# Start TDD

When you are tasked with adding new features, take a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach from now on.

## Workflow
1. Write tests based on expected input/output pairs. DO NOT write actual implementation code at this stage
2. Run tests and confirm they fail
3. Pause and ask the user to review the test cases and results
4. Write code that passes the tests. Take iterations (test and then write) until all tests pass
